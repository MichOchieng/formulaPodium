# Podium Decision Tree Classifier
This project aims to predict whether a driver in a Formula 1 race will finish in the top 3 at a specific circuit by using a decision tree classifier model. The model uses telemetry data transmitted between a team and their car, with the driver's average lap time for the circuit as one of the key features. The dataset is gathered using Ergast's API and includes data from the constructors, results, races, and circuit tables available in the Ergast database.
